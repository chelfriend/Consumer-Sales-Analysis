# Consumer-Sales-Analysis
#Project Overview:
The Customer Sales Analysis project aims to analyze customer sales data to derive actionable insights that can improve sales performance. The project involves extracting data from multiple related tables in customer sales databases using SQL, transforming and filtering the data to enhance reporting processes, and visualizing the data using Python to identify key business intelligence metrics.

#Tools Used:

SQL for data extraction and manipulation
Python for data visualization
Key Steps:

#Data Extraction:
Utilized SQL queries to extract data from 8 different related tables in the customer sales databases.
Employed JOIN operations to combine data from multiple tables and create comprehensive datasets for analysis.
Created VIEWs to simplify complex queries and improve data accessibility.
Data Transformation and Filtering:
Applied aggregating functions (e.g., SUM, AVG) to calculate total sales, average order value, and other key metrics.
Implemented filtering conditions to focus the analysis on specific customer segments, products, or time periods.
Standardized and cleaned the data to ensure consistency and accuracy in reporting.
Data Visualization:
Loaded the transformed data into Python using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.
Utilized data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful visualizations, including:
Sales trends over time (e.g., monthly or quarterly sales trends)
Customer segmentation analysis (e.g., sales by customer segment or geographic region)
Product performance analysis (e.g., top-selling products, product sales distribution)
Generated interactive visualizations using tools like Plotly to facilitate exploration and analysis of the data.
Project Outcome:
The Customer Sales Analysis project resulted in the identification of key business intelligence metrics that can inform strategic decision-making and improve sales performance. The project deliverables include SQL scripts for data extraction and manipulation, Python scripts for data visualization, and a comprehensive report summarizing the analysis findings and recommendations.
